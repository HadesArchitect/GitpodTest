## Try It Out: Cassandra Query Language (CQL)

</div>

* Difficulty: Beginner 
* Estimated Time: 5 minutes

**Cassandra Query Language (CQL)** looks like SQL because you can put data in tables containing rows and columns. So if you come from a SQL background, these terms (tables, rows and columns) have the same definition that they have in SQL. Isn't that helpful?

In this scenario, you will learn the essential CQL commands to effectively write and read data to Apache Cassandra, using the included cqlsh tool.

This scenario is also available on our [datastax.com/dev](https://datastax.com/dev) site, where you can find many more resources to help you succeed with Apache Cassandraâ„¢.
