# Describe Keyspaces

Now let's try to get the list of the keyspaces:

```
DESCRIBE KEYSPACES;
```

Here you can see all of keyspaces that have been created in the Cassandra cluster. Cassandra automatically creates keyspaces that have names starting with `system` and uses these as the data dictionary for the cluster.

*Awesome, you know how to see all your keyspaces!*
